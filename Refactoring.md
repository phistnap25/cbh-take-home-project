# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

In the refactored code, I aimed to improve readability by simplifying the nested if statements and consolidating the common logic. I removed the unnecessary variable declaration of `let candidate` and moved the assignment directly inside the condition. The code now follows a more linear flow, making it easier to understand the different paths and conditions. Additionally, I reduced code duplication by reusing the hashing logic where necessary. The unit tests cover the existing functionality of the function and ensure that the refactored code produces the same results.
